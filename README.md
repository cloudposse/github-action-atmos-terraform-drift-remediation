This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://cpco.io/sweetops) approach towards DevOps.


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).












## Introduction

This action is used for drift remediation.

There is another companion action [github-action-atmos-terraform-drift-detection](https://github.com/cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-drift-detection).



## Usage



### Workflow example

In this example drift will be remediated when user sets label `apply` to an issue.

```yaml
name: üëΩ Atmos Terraform Drift Remediation
run-name: üëΩ Atmos Terraform Drift Remediation

on:
  issues:
    types:
      - labeled
      - closed

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  remediate-drift:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Remediate Drift
    if: |
      github.event.action == 'labeled' &&
      contains(join(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, ','), 'apply')
    steps:
      - name: Remediate Drift
        uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-drift-remediation@v1
        with:
          issue-number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
          action: remediate
          atmos-config-path: "${{ github.workspace }}/rootfs/usr/local/etc/atmos/"
          terraform-plan-role: "arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/acme-core-gbl-identity-gitops"
          terraform-state-bucket: "acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops"
          terraform-state-role: "arn:aws:iam::999999999999:role/acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops-gha"
          terraform-state-table: "acme-core-ue2-auto-gitops"
          aws-region: "us-east-2"

  discard-drift:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Discard Drift
    if: |
      github.event.action == 'closed' &&
      !contains(join(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, ','), 'remediated')
    steps:
      - name: Discard Drift
        uses: cloudposse/github-action-atmos-terraform-drift-remediation@v1
        with:
          issue-number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
          action: discard
```

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|---------|----------|
| action | Drift remediation action. One of ['remediate', 'discard'] | remediate | false |
| atmos-config-path | The path to the folder where atmos.yaml file is located | . | false |
| atmos-version | Atmos version to use for vendoring. Default 'latest' | latest | false |
| aws-region | AWS region for assuming identity. | us-east-1 | false |
| debug | Enable action debug mode. Default: 'false' | false | false |
| issue-number | Issue Number | N/A | true |
| terraform-apply-role | The AWS role to be used to apply Terraform. Required for action 'remediate'. | N/A | false |
| terraform-state-bucket | The S3 Bucket where the planfiles are stored. Required for action 'remediate'. | N/A | false |
| terraform-state-role | The AWS role to be used to retrieve the planfile from AWS. Required for action 'remediate'. | N/A | false |
| terraform-state-table | The DynamoDB table where planfile metadata is stored. Required for action 'remediate'. | N/A | false |
| terraform-version | The version of Terraform CLI to install. Instead of full version string you can also specify constraint string starting with "<" (for example `<1.13.0`) to install the latest version satisfying the constraint. A value of `latest` will install the latest version of Terraform CLI. Defaults to `latest`. | latest | false |
| token | Used to pull node distributions for Atmos from Cloud Posse's GitHub repository. Since there's a default, this is typically not supplied by the user. When running this action on github.com, the default value is sufficient. When running on GHES, you can pass a personal access token for github.com if you are experiencing rate limiting. | ${{ github.server\_url == 'https://github.com' && github.token \|\| '' }} | false |
